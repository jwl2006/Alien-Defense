# Alien-Defense

A team game project modified to implement design patterns. Got **Top1** in the class competition out of **34** teams.

Design Pattern added includes:

**1. Abstract factory method.**

   Create two more enemies with differrent difficulty levels by the factory pattern.

**2. Decorator**

   Implemented decorator to decorate the health bar. Every time the health value changed, the health bar blinks.

**3. Observer**

   Observer pattern is used to track the health pickup, or the bomb the hero got and update the status.

**4. Chain of Responsibility**

   The COR pattern was implemented to calculate different scores for different enemies based on different algorithms.
